# Embryo-Grading-using-CNN

This project is a deep learning-based embryo assessment tool for IVF procedures. It predicts three key parameters from embryo images: Inner Cell Mass (ICM) quality, Trophectoderm (TE) cell quality, and Expansion stage. Grad-CAM visualizations are used to highlight the image regions influencing the grading, making the predictions more interpretable and reliable.
